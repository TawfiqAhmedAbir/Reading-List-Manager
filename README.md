**Personal Reading-List Manager — Software Engineering Resit Project**
A lightweight web application that lets you record, track, and update everything you plan to read for your course or leisure. Built with React 18, Vite, TypeScript and Tailwind on the front end, and powered by Supabase (Postgres + Auth) on the back end, it delivers full CRUD functionality with secure row-level access: after signing up or logging in, you can add a book or article (title, author, link, notes), filter your list by reading status (unread / reading / finished), edit details at any time, or delete an entry completely. The UI is mobile-first, keyboard-accessible, and deploys instantly to Vercel, so you can try the live demo right now at **[https://reading-list-manager-six.vercel.app](https://reading-list-manager-six.vercel.app)**.
To try the app create your own account via **Sign Up**. Because e-mail confirmation **is enabled**, Supabase will send a verification link to the address you enter—open that message, click **Confirm your email**, and you’ll be redirected straight into the app. From the “My Books” dashboard you can add a new title in seconds, watch it appear instantly thanks to React Query’s live cache, change its status to **finished** when you’re done, or delete it via a confirmation modal. Each record is stored with your unique Supabase user ID, so row-level security guarantees you see only your own list; the marker can create a separate account and start with an independent, empty workspace. Responsive Tailwind layouts keep the experience smooth on phone, tablet, or desktop, while Lighthouse scores stay above 90 for performance and accessibility.
Under the hood the app is a lean, modern stack: **React 18 + Vite + TypeScript** on the client, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Supabase** for Postgres storage, row-level security, and e-mail auth. State management and server interaction use **React Query**, routing is handled by **React Router 6**, and everything is automatically tested and built in a GitHub Actions CI workflow before being deployed to Vercel. If you’d like to explore or extend the code yourself, clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/TawfiqAhmedAbir/Reading-List-Manager.git`), run `npm install`, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` with your own Supabase keys, and start the dev server with `npm run dev`; the app will be live at `http://localhost:5173`. All source is MIT-licensed and fully documented in the accompanying 3 000-word coursework report, with commit history illustrating an iterative, test-driven development process.
