I, Tawfiq Ahmed Abir (student ID: 4230337), affirm that this resit submission for Software Engineering (CSI_5_SFE) is fundamentally my own work. External coding assistants were consulted only for targeted problem-solving and code-review purposes; all final design decisions, architectural choices, prose, and implementation details were authored, verified, and refined by me.

Whenever external libraries, online discussions, or documentation informed a solution, they have been cited in the Harvard reference list within the accompanying report. No source code or written content has been included verbatim without clear acknowledgement or substantial rewriting to meet the project's specific requirements.

I have taken care to keep sensitive material—such as private keys and service-role credentials—out of version control. The Git history reflects an iterative, test-driven development process carried out in a manner consistent with the University's academic-integrity guidelines.
